# MCP Development Workflow Fix ✅

## Problem Identified

The original `npm run dev` script used `tsx watch` which kept the MCP server process alive persistently. This is **fundamentally wrong** for MCP servers, which are designed to be:

- **Stateless** - No persistent state between requests
- **Spawned fresh** - Each request spawns a new server instance
- **Short-lived** - Server handles request and exits

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Package.json Scripts

**Before:**
```json
"dev": "tsx watch src/index.ts"
```

**After:**
```json
"dev": "tsx src/index.ts",
"dev:test": "node test-mcp.js"
```

### 2. Enhanced Test Script

Updated `test-mcp.js` to:
- Use `tsx` for development testing
- Properly spawn and test MCP communication
- Clean shutdown after testing
- Better error handling

### 3. Updated Documentation

Added clear MCP development workflow section in README:

```markdown
### MCP Development Workflow

**Important**: MCP servers are designed to be stateless and spawned fresh for each request. The server should not be kept alive persistently.

- **For testing**: Use `npm run dev:test` to test MCP communication
- **For manual testing**: Use `npm run dev` to run the server once
- **For production**: Use `npm start` or `npx mcp-prompt-mgmt`
```

## Testing Results

### ✅ Development Test
```bash
npm run dev:test
```
- Successfully spawns server
- Tests MCP tools/list and tools/call
- Server exits cleanly after test completion

### ✅ Manual Testing
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Server starts and runs once
- No persistent process (exits as expected)
- Proper for manual testing scenarios

### ✅ Production Build
```bash
npm start
```
- Runs built version for production use
- MCP clients can spawn this for each request

## MCP Best Practices Now Followed

1. **Stateless Design** ✅ - No persistent state between requests
2. **Fresh Spawning** ✅ - Each request gets a new server instance
3. **Proper Exit** ✅ - Server exits after handling request
4. **Development Testing** ✅ - Proper test workflow without persistent processes
5. **Production Ready** ✅ - Built version ready for MCP client spawning

## Impact

- **Fixed**: Persistent development server issue
- **Improved**: Proper MCP development workflow
- **Enhanced**: Better testing capabilities
- **Clarified**: Documentation for correct MCP usage

The server now follows MCP design principles correctly and can be properly integrated with MCP clients like Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.
